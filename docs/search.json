    "text": "SELECT u.user_id, SUM(o.amt) AS total\nFROM user u\nLEFT JOIN order_header o ON u.user_id = o.user_id\nGROUP BY user_id;\nReturns a table that looks like this: | user_id | total | |———|——–| | 1 | 52 | | 2 | 169 | | 3 | null |\nThe users who haven’t spent money will have a null in the total column. It would be interesting to sort desc or filter to only orders of that week, or maybe to market to find which is the most productive. Pretty basic but opens the door to interesting insights.\n\n\n\nSELECT u.*\nFROM user u\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_header o WHERE o.user_id = u.user_id);\nreturns a table that looks like this: | user_id | name | market | |———|———|——–| | 3 | Ruby | North |\nI chose WHERE NOT EXISTS over WHERE o.user_ID IS NULL because I think exists future proofs the query more since we are joining tables and may want to add more constraints in the future.\n\n\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_market\nON user (market);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_order_date\nON order_header (order_date);\nIf I had millions of rows, I would want to make an index of the different markets so that I can easily filter by a specific market.\nMy logic for the order table falls along those same lines. When I’m working with time data I often filter by date and creating an index would speed up the WHERE statement.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a snippet of code from my internship that I’m particularly proud of. I had to go through a dataset of points, get the overlapping ones and then rank as they rose (lowest was 1, highest was n). But if a height was missing then it needed to skip that height (start at 2). Speed was the most important factor. This code needed to comb through over thousands of points every few seconds.\n# python using pandas\ncenters[\"position\"] = centers.groupby([\"x\", \"y\"]).ngroup()\ncenters[\"heightlist\"] = centers.groupby(\"position\")[\"z\"].transform(\"count\")\navg_level = ceil(centers[\"heightlist\"].mean())\n\nfor position in centers[\"position\"].unique():\n    pos = centers.loc[(centers[\"position\"] == position)]\n    pos.sort_values(by=[\"z\"], ascending=True, inplace=True)\n\n    if pos[\"heightlist\"].min() < avg_level:\n        high = avg_level\n    else:\n        high = pos[\"heightlist\"].min()\n\n    levels = []\n    for i in range(len(pos)):\n        levels.append(high - i)\n\n    centers.loc[(centers[\"position\"] == position), \"level\"] = levels\nLine 1 centers[\"position\"] = centers.groupby([\"x\", \"y\"]).ngroup() Creates a new column named [position] and has a unique id for each unique (x,y). This is very helpful to help us filter each position later.\nLine 2 centers[\"heightlist\"] = centers.groupby(\"position\")[\"z\"].transform(\"count\") Groups by position, and counts the number of unique z values are in that position.\nLine 3 avg_level = ceil(centers[\"heightlist\"].mean()) The average heightlist for the whole dataset\nLine 4 for position in centers[\"position\"].unique(): This line ittorated through the centers.csv to find each unique position (x,y) for filtering.\nLine 5 pos = centers.loc[(centers[\"position\"] == position)] Creates a filtered dataset named pos containing only those with the same position as the loop.\nLine 6 pos.sort_values(by=[\"z\"], ascending=True, inplace=True) Sorts all of the values by their z in ascending order so that when we rank it will be from lowest to highest (1, …, n). Decided to do it inplace so that we don’t have to redefine pos again, and because we’re not losing any data.\nLines 7-10\nif pos[\"heightlist\"].min() < avg_level:\n    high = avg_level\nelse:\n    high = pos[\"heightlist\"].min()\nEven though pos should have the same heightlist for every position (since it was generated using position), I decided to use the .min() aggrigation anyway because we’re checking if it’s above the average_level. If it is above or equal to average level then it will just use the number of heights. However, if it is below average then it is missing heights and needs to start at a different number, which will be calculated from the average (so high = average).\nLines 11-13\nlevels = []\nfor i in range(len(pos)):\n    levels.append(high - i)\nlevels is a list of all of the heights. As the loop ittorates, i will become bigger and as we append make levels count down. Usually high matches the count of rows, so levels counts down to one [5, ..., 1]. However, if it was determined to not have enough levels it will only count down from average [5, ..., 2].\nLine 14 centers.loc[(centers[\"position\"] == position), \"level\"] = levels This maps the correct height to the centers.csv using the levels list using .loc. It filters down to all the rows with the same position, then defines the column [level] to match the list levels. The filtered centers.csv and the levels list must be the same length or else there will be errors, but because we calculated the levels list using the length of the filtered dataframe they should always match."

    "text": "General Quality of Life\nThese are the extensions that improve VS Code as a whole. These are also the “optional” extensions that I use the most (i.e. not required to function like Python or Git).\n\nBetter Comments\nAs you can see by the whole section dedicated to themes, I’m a visual person. So an extension that can visually differentiate intentions between comments was a game changer. Now I can visually see the difference between warning and todo comments. Cannot recommend enough.\n\n\nBookmarks\nThis lets you put bookmarks throughout your scripts. This really helps with navigation, but I also used it to keep track of what I want to work on next and make a todo list. It also adds a bookmark page on the action bar. However, now that I usually use Jupyter Notebooks I don’t personally use this extension as much as I used to.\n\n\nLive Share\nIf you work with other people, especially remotely like I do, this tool is indispensable. It lets you both edit the same file or files at the same time. Took coding meetings from tedious backseat driving (click here, type this) to fun and productive collaboration sessions and cut the time in half. It even automatically includes their handle as a co-author in any git commits!\n\n\nTabOut\nIf you only get one extension from this article, this is it.\nInstead of using right arrows to get out of parenthesis, brackets, or quotes you just hit tab. You don’t need to lift your hand from the keyboard to hit the arrow keys, you just reach up and tab out. It nearly brought me to tears the first time I used it. Cannot recommend enough."

    "text": "Themes\nThese affect the look of VS Code from colors to icons.\n\nColor Themes\nI am a very visual person, so how my code works is very important to me. Every time I open VS Code the first thing I do is hit Ctrl + K & Ctrl + T to change the visual theme to match my mood. I have come to discover that my mood linked to my environment, and that doesn’t end at my decor. If I like looking at my code I like coding more.\n\nNoctis is the most beginner friendly theme pack with only 11 choices.\nFavorites: Bordos, Sereno\nBearded Theme was my favorite for years and has a good spread of themes with 32 variations. I especially like the high contrast themes.\nFavorites: Surprising Watermelon, Ebony, Milkshake Raspberry\nRainglow is the mother of all theme packs. It has 320 themes, which is a little overwhelming at first. But I really enjoy ruffling through them for the perfect theme for my coding session. The thing I love most is that there are more than one version of each theme, a normal and a high contrast theme.\nFavorites: Earth Song Light, Frontier light, Grunge light, Hyrule Contrast, Mud Contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out if a theme is high contrast or not. Some people like low contrast because the other code fades into the background and allows them to only focus on what they’re writing. I prefer high contrast themes because I have very sensitive eyes that strain easily.\n\n\n\nHonerable mentions: Github Theme, Dracula Official, & Theme\n\n\nMaterial Icon Theme & Material Product Icons\nThese themes change the look of VS Code interface itself. I never change these themes.\nI love the Material Icon Theme because not only does it change the file icons to differentiate file types but it also changes folder icons depending on its name. I love this extension so much that I have gone back through some repositories and changed folder names to fit with this extension. But if Material Icon Theme is overwhelming or not to your taste I also recommend Bearded Icons from the same developer as Bearded Theme.\nHonestly, I just use Product Icons because for consistency. It’s not important but shows VS Code’s flexibility."

In this repository I use issues to keep track of ideas for new blog posts and this is a game changer.\n\n\nGitHub Copilot (*subscription)\nAI is the future and that’s no different with coding. Github Copilot will write code for you and help streamline your flow. It comes with a 30 day free trial and is $10 a month after. I’ve just started copilot and may write a blog post about it in the future but so far it’s amazing!

    "text": "General Quality of Life\nThese are the extensions that improve VS Code as a whole. These are also the “optional” extensions that I use the most (i.e. not required to function like Python or Git).\n\nBetter Comments\nAs you can see by the whole section dedicated to themes, I’m a visual person. So an extension that can visually differentiate intentions between comments was a game changer. Now I can visually see the difference between warning and todo comments. Cannot recommend enough.\n\n\nBookmarks\nThis lets you put bookmarks throughout your scripts. This really helps with navigation, but I also used it to keep track of what I want to work on next and make a todo list. It also adds a bookmark page on the action bar. However, now that I usually use Jupyter Notebooks I don’t personally use this extension as much as I used to.\n\n\nLive Share\nIf you work with other people, especially remotely like I do, this tool is indispensable. It lets you both edit the same file or files at the same time. Took coding meetings from tedious backseat driving (click here, type this) to fun and productive collaboration sessions and cut the time in half. It even automatically includes their handle as a co-author in any git commits!\n\n\nTabOut\nIf you only get one extension from this article, this is it.\nInstead of using right arrows to get out of parenthesis, brackets, or quotes you just hit tab. You don’t need to lift your hand from the keyboard to hit the arrow keys, you just reach up and tab out. It nearly brought me to tears the first time I used it. Cannot recommend enough."

    "text": "Themes\nThese affect the look of VS Code from colors to icons.\n\nColor Themes\nI am a very visual person, so how my code works is very important to me. Every time I open VS Code the first thing I do is hit Ctrl + K & Ctrl + T to change the visual theme to match my mood. I have come to discover that my mood linked to my environment, and that doesn’t end at my decor. If I like looking at my code I like coding more.\n\nNoctis is the most beginner friendly theme pack with only 11 choices.\nFavorites: Bordos, Sereno\nBearded Theme was my favorite for years and has a good spread of themes with 32 variations. I especially like the high contrast themes.\nFavorites: Surprising Watermelon, Ebony, Milkshake Raspberry\nRainglow is the mother of all theme packs. It has 320 themes, which is a little overwhelming at first. But I really enjoy ruffling through them for the perfect theme for my coding session. The thing I love most is that there are more than one version of each theme, a normal and a high contrast theme.\nFavorites: Earth Song Light, Frontier light, Grunge light, Hyrule Contrast, Mud Contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out if a theme is high contrast or not. Some people like low contrast because the other code fades into the background and allows them to only focus on what they’re writing. I prefer high contrast themes because I have very sensitive eyes that strain easily.\n\n\n\nHonerable mentions: Github Theme, Dracula Official, & Theme\n\n\nMaterial Icon Theme & Material Product Icons\nThese themes change the look of VS Code interface itself. I never change these themes.\nI love the Material Icon Theme because not only does it change the file icons to differentiate file types but it also changes folder icons depending on its name. I love this extension so much that I have gone back through some repositories and changed folder names to fit with this extension. But if Material Icon Theme is overwhelming or not to your taste I also recommend Bearded Icons from the same developer as Bearded Theme.\nHonestly, I just use Product Icons because for consistency. It’s not important but shows VS Code’s flexibility."

It allows you to make an issue, create a branch for that issue, edit the code, create a pull request, and merge all within VS Code. In this repository I use issues to keep track of ideas for new blog posts and this is a game changer.\n\n\nGitHub Copilot (*subscription)\nAI is the future and that’s no different with coding. Github Copilot will write code for you and help streamline your flow. It comes with a 30 day free trial and is $10 a month after. I’ve just started copilot and may write a blog post about it in the future but so far it’s amazing!

    "text": "General Quality of Life\nThese are the extensions that improve VS Code as a whole. These are also the “optional” extensions that I use the most (i.e. not required to function like Python or Git).\n\nBetter Comments\nAs you can see by the whole section dedicated to themes, I’m a visual person. So an extension that can visually differentiate intentions between comments was a game changer. Now I can visually see the difference between warning and todo comments. Cannot recommend enough.\n\n\nBookmarks\nThis lets you put bookmarks throughout your scripts. This really helps with navigation, but I also used it to keep track of what I want to work on next and make a todo list. It also adds a bookmark page on the action bar. However, now that I usually use Jupyter Notebooks I don’t personally use this extension as much as I used to.\n\n\nLive Share\nIf you work with other people, especially remotely like I do, this tool is indispensable. It lets you both edit the same file or files at the same time. Took coding meetings from tedious backseat driving (click here, type this) to fun and productive collaboration sessions and cut the time in half. It even automatically includes their handle as a co-author in any git commits!\n\n\nTabOut\nIf you only get one extension from this article, this is it.\nInstead of using right arrows to get out of parenthesis, brackets, or quotes you just hit tab. You don’t need to lift your hand from the keyboard to hit the arrow keys, you just reach up and tab out. It nearly brought me to tears the first time I used it. Cannot recommend enough."

Every time I open VS Code the first thing I do is hit Ctrl + K & Ctrl + T to change the visual theme to match my mood. I have come to discover that my mood linked to my environment, and that doesn’t end at my decor. If I like looking at my code I like coding more.\n\nNoctis is the most beginner friendly theme pack with only 11 choices.\nFavorites: Bordos, Sereno\nBearded Theme was my favorite for years and has a good spread of themes with 32 variations. I especially like the high contrast themes.\nFavorites: Surprising Watermelon, Ebony, Milkshake Raspberry\nRainglow is the mother of all theme packs. It has 320 themes, which is a little overwhelming at first. But I really enjoy ruffling through them for the perfect theme for my coding session. The thing I love most is that there are more than one version of each theme, a normal and a high contrast theme.\nFavorites: Earth Song Light, Frontier light, Grunge light, Hyrule Contrast, Mud Contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out if a theme is high contrast or not. Some people like low contrast because the other code fades into the background and allows them to only focus on what they’re writing. I prefer high contrast themes because I have very sensitive eyes that strain easily.\n\n\n\nHonerable mentions: Github Theme, Dracula Official, & Theme\n\n\nMaterial Icon Theme & Material Product Icons\nThese themes change the look of VS Code interface itself. I never change these themes.\nI love the Material Icon Theme because not only does it change the file icons to differentiate file types but it also changes folder icons depending on its name. I love this extension so much that I have gone back through some repositories and changed folder names to fit with this extension. But if Material Icon Theme is overwhelming or not to your taste I also recommend Bearded Icons from the same developer as Bearded Theme.\nHonestly, I just use Product Icons because for consistency. It’s not important but shows VS Code’s flexibility."

In this repository I use issues to keep track of ideas for new blog posts and this is a game changer.\n\n\nGitHub Copilot (*subscription)\nAI is the future and that’s no different with coding. Github Copilot will write code for you and help streamline your flow. It comes with a 30 day free trial and is $10 a month after. I’ve just started copilot and may write a blog post about it in the future but so far it’s amazing!

This also makes documentation a lot easier (meaning you’ll actually do documentation lol).\ndef new_function(arg1: str, arg2: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prints the arguments\n\n    Args:\n        arg1 (str): a string that you want to print\n        arg2 (int): an int that you want to print\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}\")\n\n\nPylint\nLint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.1 Using a linter like Pylint helps keep code consistent and up to standard.\n\n\nFormatters: Black (python & jupyter) & Prettier\nNot to be dramatic, but I would not still be coding without code formatters. As I mentioned earlier, I am a very visual person so I want my code to be pretty too. Enter: formatters.\nI have been using Black for years, and love the auto formatting on save feature. I was so attached to Black that I almost refused to use Jupyter notebooks until the March 2023 update finally allowed it. It is so satisfying to see your scrappy code instantly turn beautiful, making block-text dictionaries beautiful and messy functions readable.\nFor anything that’s not Python or Jupyter I use Prettier because it’s reliable and has tons of languages. The ones I probably use the most is YAML and markdown.\n\n\nMarkdown: Markdown All in One, Markdown Checkbox, & markdownlint\nBesides Python/Jupyter, Markdown is probably the language I use most. I use markdown to take notes and write documentation, and Github Display pages run on markdown. So I have a few extensions to help streamline the process.\nMarkdown All in One is a heavy hitter. This lets you automatically create a table of contents, Auto completions, print to HTML. My favorite feature is add/update/remove section numbering to remove the headache of manually redoing it.\nMarkdown Checkbox is a really simple extension that just inserts a checkbox.\nMarkdownLint is the same principle as Pylint and helps make markdown formatting more consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this Markdown Extension Pack to get all of these extensions and more!"

I hate opening Excel and having another program bog down my system’s ram. Chef’s kiss.\n\n\nSandDance for VSCode\nSandDance lets you do some visual analysis on datasets. I like using it to get basic insights without having to manually program the charts myself. But it is a beast to run so use it wisely.\n\n\nQuarto\nQuarto is a great way to make a blog! I use it to make this blog right now. It used to be RMarkdown but you can now use it as it’s own language. Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit your posts in Visual Mode - right click in the document and select Visual Mode. Turns Visual Studio code into an actual document editor and lets you do fancy things like insert and edit tables, format, add links, and so much more! (This works with any markdown document, not just Quarto!)"

    "text": "General Quality of Life\nThese are the extensions that improve VS Code as a whole. These are also the “optional” extensions that I use the most (i.e. not required to function like Python or Git).\n\nBetter Comments\nAs you can see by the whole section dedicated to themes, I’m a visual person. So an extension that can visually differentiate intentions between comments was a game changer. Now I can visually see the difference between warning and todo comments. Cannot recommend enough.\n\n\nBookmarks\nThis lets you put bookmarks throughout your scripts. This really helps with navigation, but I also used it to keep track of what I want to work on next and make a todo list. It also adds a bookmark page on the action bar. However, now that I usually use Jupyter Notebooks I don’t personally use this extension as much as I used to.\n\n\nLive Share\nIf you work with other people, especially remotely like I do, this tool is indispensable. It lets you both edit the same file or files at the same time. Took coding meetings from tedious backseat driving (click here, type this) to fun and productive collaboration sessions and cut the time in half. It even automatically includes their handle as a co-author in any git commits!\n\n\nTabOut\nIf you only get one extension from this article, this is it.\nInstead of using right arrows to get out of parenthesis, brackets, or quotes you just hit tab. You don’t need to lift your hand from the keyboard to hit the arrow keys, you just reach up and tab out. It nearly brought me to tears the first time I used it. Cannot recommend enough."

Every time I open VS Code the first thing I do is hit Ctrl + K & Ctrl + T to change the visual theme to match my mood. I have come to discover that my mood linked to my environment, and that doesn’t end at my decor. If I like looking at my code I like coding more.\n\nNoctis is the most beginner friendly theme pack with only 11 choices.\nFavorites: Bordos, Sereno\nBearded Theme was my favorite for years and has a good spread of themes with 32 variations. I especially like the high contrast themes.\nFavorites: Surprising Watermelon, Ebony, Milkshake Raspberry\nRainglow is the mother of all theme packs. It has 320 themes, which is a little overwhelming at first. But I really enjoy ruffling through them for the perfect theme for my coding session. The thing I love most is that there are more than one version of each theme, a normal and a high contrast theme.\nFavorites: Earth Song Light, Frontier light, Grunge light, Hyrule Contrast, Mud Contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out if a theme is high contrast or not. Some people like low contrast because the other code fades into the background and allows them to only focus on what they’re writing. I prefer high contrast themes because I have very sensitive eyes that strain easily.\n\n\n\nHonerable mentions: Github Theme, Dracula Official, & Theme\n\n\nMaterial Icon Theme & Material Product Icons\nThese themes change the look of VS Code interface itself. I never change these themes.\nI love the Material Icon Theme because not only does it change the file icons to differentiate file types but it also changes folder icons depending on its name. I love this extension so much that I have gone back through some repositories and changed folder names to fit with this extension. But if Material Icon Theme is overwhelming or not to your taste I also recommend Bearded Icons from the same developer as Bearded Theme.\nHonestly, I just use Product Icons because for consistency. It’s not important but shows VS Code’s flexibility."

In this repository I use issues to keep track of ideas for new blog posts and this is a game changer.\n\n\nGitHub Copilot (*subscription)\nAI is the future and that’s no different with coding. Github Copilot will write code for you and help streamline your flow. It comes with a 30 day free trial and is $10 a month after.

This also makes documentation a lot easier (meaning you’ll actually do documentation lol).\ndef new_function(arg1: str, arg2: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prints the arguments\n\n    Args:\n        arg1 (str): a string that you want to print\n        arg2 (int): an int that you want to print\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}\")\n\n\nPylint\nLint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.1 Using a linter like Pylint helps keep code consistent and up to standard.\n\n\nFormatters: Black (python & jupyter) & Prettier\nNot to be dramatic, but I would not still be coding without code formatters. As I mentioned earlier, I am a very visual person so I want my code to be pretty too. Enter: formatters.\nI have been using Black for years, and love the auto formatting on save feature. I was so attached to Black that I almost refused to use Jupyter notebooks until the March 2023 update finally allowed it. It is so satisfying to see your scrappy code instantly turn beautiful, making block-text dictionaries beautiful and messy functions readable.\nFor anything that’s not Python or Jupyter I use Prettier because it’s reliable and has tons of languages. The ones I probably use the most is YAML and markdown.\n\n\nMarkdown: Markdown All in One, Markdown Checkbox, & markdownlint\nBesides Python/Jupyter, Markdown is probably the language I use most. I use markdown to take notes and write documentation, and Github Display pages run on markdown. So I have a few extensions to help streamline the process.\nMarkdown All in One is a heavy hitter. This lets you automatically create a table of contents, Auto completions, print to HTML. My favorite feature is add/update/remove section numbering to remove the headache of manually redoing it.\nMarkdown Checkbox is a really simple extension that just inserts a checkbox.\nMarkdownLint is the same principle as Pylint and helps make markdown formatting more consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this Markdown Extension Pack to get all of these extensions and more!"

I hate opening Excel and having another program bog down my system’s ram. Chef’s kiss.\n\n\nSandDance for VSCode\nSandDance lets you do some visual analysis on datasets. I like using it to get basic insights without having to manually program the charts myself. But it is a beast to run so use it wisely.\n\n\nQuarto\nQuarto is a great way to make a blog! I use it to make this blog right now. It used to be RMarkdown but you can now use it as it’s own language. Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit your posts in Visual Mode - right click in the document and select Visual Mode. Turns Visual Studio code into an actual document editor and lets you do fancy things like insert and edit tables, format, add links, and so much more! (This works with any markdown document, not just Quarto!)"

    "text": "When I first made my Quarto blog, the first thing I wanted to do was claim it! So here’s a detailed guide on how to make your About page ABOUT YOU!\nHere’s a link to the Quarto About Page docs.\n\n1️⃣ Claim it\nFill in the YAML at the top. Add your name, your picture, and anything you want to highlight. I have LinkedIn and GitHub, but you can add any Bootstrap 5 icon!\ntitle: &lt;name here&gt;\nabout:\n    image: profile.jpg\n    template: jolla\n    links:\n    - icon: linkedin\n      text: LinkedIn\n      href: &lt;link to LinkedIn profile here\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: &lt;link to GitHub account page here&gt;\nYou should also describe yourself! Avoid big blocks of text - use bullet points, lists, and unique formatting to make it easy to read (and don’t forget to use emojis!)\n-   👀 I'm interested in\n-   💗 I'm passionate about\n-   🔭 I'm currently working on ...\n-   🌱 I'm currently learning ...\n-   💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on\n-   👯 I'm looking to collaborate on ...\n-   🤔 I'm looking for help with ...\n-   💬 Ask me about ...\n-   📫 How to reach me: ...\n-   ⚡ Fun fact: ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to have bullet points, have two empty spaces at the end of each line to force a line break!\n\n\nAnd don’t forget to add your education and work experience!\n\n\n2️⃣ Embeds\nQuarto is the next evolution of R Markdown, meaning it’s a markdown file! Anything that can be embedded in markdown (HTML, iframes, etc.) can be embedded in Quarto.\nA non-exhaustive list:\n\nMaps\nVideos\nTweets\nInstagram Posts\nSpotify Playlists\nGitHub Gists\n\nI decided on 2 Github stats apps, but you can add anything you want!\n![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=&lt;username&gt;&show_icons=true)\n![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=&lt;username&gt;&layout=compact)\n\nI also included the icons of my favorite languages and tools using Skill Icons, and some HTML to center it\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"https://skillicons.dev\"&gt; \n    &lt;img src=\"https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode\"/&gt; \n  &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  \n\n\n\n3️⃣ Templates\nQuarto has five templates you can use to make your About page look even better: jolla, trestles, solana, marquee, and broadside. You can see them all here.\nI chose jolla because I liked how it was centered like my GitHub stats. To use a template, add the following to your YAML:\nabout:\n  template: solana\nIf you don’t like your image being a circle or you don’t like the size, you can change it to a rectangle by adding the following to your YAML:\nabout:\n  template: marquee\n  image-width: 10em\n  image-shape: rectangle"
