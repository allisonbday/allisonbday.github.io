The day has finally come - predator has become prey and programmers have created the vehicle of their own doom. AI will take over all of our jobs and resistance is futile.

Just kidding. Like any new advancement, we can use this amazing AI tool for our benefit! One of the most popular AI pair programmers is Github Copilot. According to the website, "Trained on billions of lines of code, GitHub Copilot turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages."

# Setup

Signing up was very simple. Just the normal billing address and a way to pay and off you are! You do have to still provide the payment method for the 30 day free trial.

After signing up for Copilot and enabling it in VS Code, I was excited to experiment with Copilot. But no matter what I did it didn't work! An hour later and half a dozen failed tutorials I noticed there was a little copilot logo in the bottom right of my VS Code. When I clicked on it this menu came up and after enabling it globally it worked perfectly. ðŸ¤¦
