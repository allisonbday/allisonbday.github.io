# Introduction

Your blog should show your personality. When I started to take blogging seriously, I wanted to customize my blog to make it more personal. I wanted to change the theme, colors, and fonts. <!--I also wanted to add a favicon to my blog. -->

# Pages

When you create a base Quarto blog, you get a couple of pages: an About page and an index page. I wanted to add a series page and a landing page too.

## About Page

After filling in the `about.md` file by adding a bit about me and my education and experience, I wanted to do more customization.

### Apps

Since Quarto is built on top of R Markdown, anything that can be added to markdown is available in Quarto! This includes some fun [Github readme-stats](https://github.com/topics/readme-stats) apps.

First, I added a list of icons for my most used skills using the [skill-icon](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons#readme) app. I also wanted them centered, so I added a bit of html to the code.

```{markdown}
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skillicons.dev">
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode" />
  </a>
</p>
```

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skillicons.dev">
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode" />
  </a>
</p>

I also wanted some of my Github Stats, so I added the [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). You can replace `<username>` with your Github username. These come with lots of customization, but I like how their basic layout looks. *(To get the apps side by side, you put them on the same line)*

```{markdown}
![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=<username>&show_icons=true)
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=<username>&layout=compact)
```

![Allison\'s GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=allisonbday&show_icons=true) ![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=allisonbday&hide_progress=true)

### Templates

The layout also needed an update. Luckily, Quarto has five templates to change up the layout. You can change the template using the `template` option in the YAML header. The five templates are `jolla` *(default)*, `trestles`, `solana`, `marquee`, and `broadside`.

```{yaml}
---
title: "About Me"
about:
  template: jolla
---
```

After testing them all, I decided to go with the `jolla` theme. I like that the photo and title are centered on the page, matching my centered skill icons.


## Create a Landing Page

# Theme

I wanted to change the theme of my blog to something that was more me. First, I went to the [Quarto Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#themes) page and looked at the themes there to see if there was one that I liked. Each of them had their merits but none of them spoke to me. So I moved on to plan B: make my own theme.

# Favicon

A Favicon is the little icon that is in the tab on your browser next to the URL. I wanted to have a Quarto on my blog, and if I make a logo for myself I could change it to that in the future.

To add a favicon to my blog, I followed [this tutorial](https://github.com/tkshill/Quarto/issues/3). It was really simple, but to sum it up you go to [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and put in my quarto favicon that I made in 30 seconds in Microsoft Paint, but you can use any image that is 260x260 pixels. Then it generated a zip folder that I extracted into my blog's root.
