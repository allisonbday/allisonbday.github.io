# Quarto Themes

There are over 25 default themes in Quarto. You can see them all [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html).

To change the theme, simply go into your `_quarto.yml` file and change the `theme` parameter. You can also add a dark mode to your website!

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: 
      light: pulse
      dark: darkly
```

Of the default themes, My favorites were pulse and slate.
